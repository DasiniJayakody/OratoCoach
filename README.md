## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Camera Not Working**

- Check camera permissions in your browser
- Ensure no other applications are using the camera
- Try refreshing the page or restarting the application

**Analysis Not Starting**

- Make sure you've selected at least one analysis type
- Check that all dependencies are installed correctly
- Verify Python version (3.8+)

**Slow Performance**

- Close other applications using the camera
- Ensure good lighting conditions
- Check system resources and available memory

**PDF Download Issues**

- Ensure the data folder exists and has write permissions
- Check file permissions in your system
- Try refreshing the results page

### Error Messages

**"Camera access denied"**

- Allow camera access in your browser settings
- Check if camera is being used by another application
- Try a different browser

**"Analysis failed"**

- Check console for detailed error messages
- Ensure all required packages are installed
- Verify camera functionality with other applications

**"PDF generation failed"**

- Check if the data directory exists
- Verify write permissions
- Ensure FPDF is installed correctly

### Fix: "Invalid requirement: '<<<<<<< HEAD'" when running pip

- If pip reports a line like "<<<<<<< HEAD" in requirements.txt, your requirements file has merge conflict markers. Replace requirements.txt with a clean file (see requirements.txt in this repo) or remove the conflict markers manually.

### Fix: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'

- Make sure your virtual environment is activated, then install dependencies:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- Alternatively install Flask directly:

  ```bash
  pip install Flask
  ```

- If you still see errors, confirm you're using the correct Python interpreter tied to your virtual environment.
